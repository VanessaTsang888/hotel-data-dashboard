# Interactive Hotel Data Dashboard

This website application uses the power of 'AI and [Streamlit Python library](https://streamlit.io/)' to build an interactive visualisation data dashboards in Python (programming language) and [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/).

The user can utilise the AI Bot to create various charts, refine the data within those charts and organise/layout the charts with the help of the Bot. Users can also utilise the filters feature on the left sidebar, submit their feedback to the dashboard software developer.

## OpenAI Platform

The AI model I am using is the [gpt-3.5-turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3.5-turbo) because this model is fast, efficient, robust and afforable.

## Dataset

I am using the [Landon Hotel - sample data](https://www.landonhotel.com/) because this is a fictitious boutique hotel with locations world wide which is perfect for this project to demonstrate my AI-powered software development tech skills.
